    - neroAacEnc:
        - Added progress display
        - Writes mpeg-4 tags at the beginning of the MP4/3GP files
        - Supports multiple input files (-if) and produces a multichapter MP4
          file when more than one input file is present
        - Added backwards compatible signalling of SBR and PS Audio Object Types
          (also when LC is used for encoding) for improved 3GPP Compatibility
