\subsection{Detailed Description}
Architecture-\/dependent type for oggz\-\_\-off\-\_\-t. This file should never be included directly by user code. Please include either of $<$\doxyref{oggz/oggz.\-h}{p.}{oggz_8h}$>$ or $<$\doxyref{oggz/oggz\-\_\-off\-\_\-t.\-h}{p.}{oggz__off__t_8h}$>$ instead.

This file was generated when liboggz was built.

This typedef was determined on the system on which the documentation was generated. 

To query this on your system, do eg.


\begin{DoxyPre}
  echo "gcc -E \doxyref{oggz.h}{p.}{oggz_8h} | grep oggz\_off\_t
