\section{Oggz makes programming with Ogg easy!}\label{index_intro}
This is the documentation for the Oggz C A\-P\-I. Oggz provides a simple programming interface for reading and writing Ogg files and streams. Ogg is an interleaving data container developed by Monty at {\tt Xiph.\-Org}, originally to support the Ogg Vorbis audio format.

liboggz supports the flexibility afforded by the Ogg file format while presenting the following A\-P\-I niceties\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Strict adherence to the formatting requirements of Ogg \doxyref{bitstreams }{p.}{group__basics}, to ensure that only valid bitstreams are generated
\item A simple, callback based open/read/close or open/write/close \doxyref{interface }{p.}{oggz_8h} to raw Ogg files
\item A customisable \doxyref{seeking }{p.}{group__seek__api} abstraction for seeking on multitrack Ogg data
\item A packet queue for feeding incoming packets for writing, with callback based notification when this queue is empty
\item A means of overriding the \doxyref{I\-O functions }{p.}{oggz__io_8h} used by Oggz, for easier integration with media frameworks and similar systems.
\item A handy \doxyref{table }{p.}{oggz__table_8h} structure for storing information on each logical bitstream
