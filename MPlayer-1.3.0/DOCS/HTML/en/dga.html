This document tries to explain in some words what DGA is in general and
what the DGA video output driver for <span class="application">MPlayer</span>
can do (and what it can't).
</p><p><b>WHAT IS DGA. </b>
<acronym class="acronym">DGA</acronym> is short for <span class="emphasis"><em>Direct Graphics
Access</em></span> and is a means for a program to bypass the X server and
directly modifying the framebuffer memory. Technically spoken this happens
by mapping the framebuffer memory into the memory range of your process.
This is allowed by the kernel only if you have superuser privileges. You
can get these either by logging in as <code class="systemitem">root</code> or by setting the SUID bit on the
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> executable (<span class="bold"><strong>not
recommended</strong></span>).
</p><p>
There are two versions of DGA: DGA1 is used by XFree 3.x.x and DGA2 was
introduced with XFree 4.0.1.
</p><p>
DGA1 provides only direct framebuffer access as described above. For
switching the resolution of the video signal you have to rely on the
XVidMode extension.
</p><p>
DGA2 incorporates the features of XVidMode extension and also allows
switching the depth of the display. So you may, although basically
running a 32 bit depth X server, switch to a depth of 15 bits and vice
versa.
</p><p>
However DGA has some drawbacks. It seems it is somewhat dependent on the
graphics chip you use and on the implementation of the X server's video
driver that controls this chip. So it does not work on every system...
</p><p><b>INSTALLING DGA SUPPORT FOR MPLAYER. </b>
First make sure X loads the DGA extension, see in
<tt class="filename">/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt>:

</p><pre class="programlisting">(II) Loading extension XFree86-DGA</pre><p>

See, XFree86 4.0.x or greater is
<span class="bold"><strong>highly recommended</strong></span>!
<span class="application">MPlayer</span>'s DGA driver is autodetected by
<tt class="filename">./configure</tt>, or you can force it
with <tt class="option">--enable-dga</tt>.
</p><p>
If the driver couldn't switch to a smaller resolution, experiment with
options <tt class="option">-vm</tt> (only with X 3.3.x), <tt class="option">-fs</tt>,
<tt class="option">-bpp</tt>, <tt class="option">-zoom</tt> to find a video mode that
the movie fits in. There is no converter right now :(
</p><p>
Become <code class="systemitem">root</code>. DGA needs root
access to be able to write directly video memory. If you want to run it as
user, then install <span class="application">MPlayer</span> SUID root:

</p><pre class="screen">
chown root <em class="replaceable"><code>/usr/local/bin/mplayer</code></em>
chmod 750 <em class="replaceable"><code>/usr/local/bin/mplayer</code></em>
chmod +s <em class="replaceable"><code>/usr/local/bin/mplayer</code></em>
</pre><p>

Now it works as a simple user, too.
</p><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Security risk</h3><p>
This is a <span class="bold"><strong>big</strong></span> security risk!
<span class="bold"><strong>Never</strong></span> do this on a server or on a computer
that can be accessed by other people because they can gain root privileges
through SUID root <span class="application">MPlayer</span>.
</p></div><p>
Now use <tt class="option">-vo dga</tt> option, and there you go! (hope so:) You
should also try if the <tt class="option">-vo sdl:driver=dga</tt> option works for you!
It's much faster!
</p><p><a name="dga-modelines"></a><b>RESOLUTION SWITCHING. </b>
The DGA driver allows for switching the resolution of the output signal.
This avoids the need for doing (slow) software scaling and at the same time
provides a fullscreen image. Ideally it would switch to the exact
resolution (except for honoring aspect ratio) of the video data, but the X
server only allows switching to resolutions predefined in
<tt class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config</tt>
(<tt class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</tt> for XFree 4.X.X respectively).
Those are defined by so-called modelines and depend on
the capabilities of your video hardware. The X server scans this config
file on startup and disables the modelines not suitable for your hardware.
You can find out which modes survive with the X11 log file. It can be found
at: <tt class="filename">/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt>.
</p><p>
These entries are known to work fine with a Riva128 chip, using the nv.o X
server driver module.

</pre><p><b>DGA &amp; MPLAYER. </b>
DGA is used in two places with <span class="application">MPlayer</span>: The SDL
driver can be made to make use of it (<tt class="option">-vo sdl:driver=dga</tt>) and
within the DGA driver (<tt class="option">-vo dga</tt>). The above said is true
for both; in the following sections I'll explain how the DGA driver for
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> works.
</p><p><b>FEATURES. </b>
The DGA driver is invoked by specifying <tt class="option">-vo dga</tt> at the
command line. The default behavior is to switch to a resolution matching
the original resolution of the video as close as possible. It deliberately
ignores the <tt class="option">-vm</tt> and <tt class="option">-fs</tt> options
(enabling of video mode switching and fullscreen) - it always tries to
cover as much area of your screen as possible by switching the video mode,
thus refraining from using additional cycles of your CPU to scale the
image. If you don't like the mode it chooses you may force it to choose
the mode matching closest the resolution you specify by <tt class="option">-x</tt>
and <tt class="option">-y</tt>. By providing the <tt class="option">-v</tt> option, the
DGA driver will print, among a lot of other things, a list of all
resolutions supported by your current <tt class="filename">XF86Config</tt> file.
Having DGA2 you may also force it to use a certain depth by using the
<tt class="option">-bpp</tt> option. Valid depths are 15, 16, 24 and 32. It
depends on your hardware whether these depths are natively supported or if
a (possibly slow) conversion has to be done.
</p><p>
If you should be lucky enough to have enough offscreen memory left to
put a whole image there, the DGA driver will use double buffering, which
results in much smoother movie playback. It will tell you whether
double buffering is enabled or not.
</p><p>
Double buffering means that the next frame of your video is being drawn in
some offscreen memory while the current frame is being displayed. When the
next frame is ready, the graphics chip is just told the location in memory
of the new frame and simply fetches the data to be displayed from there.
In the meantime the other buffer in memory will be filled again with new
video data.
</p><p>
Double buffering may be switched on by using the option
<tt class="option">-double</tt> and may be disabled with
<tt class="option">-nodouble</tt>. Current default option is to disable
double buffering. When using the DGA driver, onscreen display (OSD) only
works with double buffering enabled. However, enabling double buffering may
result in a big speed penalty (on my K6-II+ 525 it used an additional 20%
of CPU time!) depending on the implementation of DGA for your hardware.
</p><p><b>SPEED ISSUES. </b>
Generally spoken, DGA framebuffer access should be at least as fast as
using the X11 driver with the additional benefit of getting a fullscreen
image. The percentage speed values printed by
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> have to be interpreted with some care,
as for example, with the X11 driver they do not include the time used by
the X server needed for the actual drawing. Hook a terminal to a serial
line of your box and start <span class="command"><strong>top</strong></span> to see what is really
going on in your box.
</p><p>
Generally spoken, the speedup done by using DGA against 'normal' use of X11
highly depends on your graphics card and how well the X server module for it
is optimized.
</p><p>
If you have a slow system, better use 15 or 16 bit depth since they require
only half the memory bandwidth of a 32 bit display.
</p><p>
Using a depth of 24 bit is a good idea even if your card natively just supports
32 bit depth since it transfers 25% less data compared to the 32/32 mode.
</p><p>
I've seen some AVI files be played back on a Pentium MMX 266. AMD K6-2
CPUs might work at 400 MHZ and above.
</p><p><b>KNOWN BUGS. </b>
Well, according to some developers of XFree, DGA is quite a beast. They
tell you better not to use it. Its implementation is not always flawless
with every chipset driver for XFree out there.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
  With XFree 4.0.3 and <tt class="filename">nv.o</tt> there is a bug resulting
  in strange colors.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  ATI driver requires to switch mode back more than once after finishing

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Some drivers simply fail to switch back to normal resolution (use
  <span class="keycap"><b>Ctrl</b></span>+<span class="keycap"><b>Alt</b></span>+<span class="keycap"><b>Keypad +</b></span>
  and
  <span class="keycap"><b>Ctrl</b></span>+<span class="keycap"><b>Alt</b></span>+<span class="keycap"><b>Keypad -</b></span>
  to switch back manually).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Some drivers simply display strange colors.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Some drivers lie about the amount of memory they map into the process's
  address space, thus vo_dga won't use double buffering (SIS?).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Some drivers seem to fail to report even a single valid mode. In this
  case the DGA driver will crash telling you about a nonsense mode of
  100000x100000 or something like that.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  OSD only works with double buffering enabled (else it flickers).
