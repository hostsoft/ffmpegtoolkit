One frequently asked question is "How do I make the highest quality rip
for a given size?". Another question is "How do I make the highest
quality DVD rip possible? I do not care about file size, I just want the best
quality."
</p><p>
The latter question is perhaps at least somewhat wrongly posed. After all, if
you do not care about file size, why not simply copy the entire MPEG-2 video
stream from the the DVD? Sure, your AVI will end up being 5GB, give
or take, but if you want the best quality and do not care about size,
this is certainly your best option.
</p><p>
In fact, the reason you want to transcode a DVD into MPEG-4 is
specifically because you <span class="bold"><strong>do</strong></span> care about
file size.
</p><p>
It is difficult to offer a cookbook recipe on how to create a very high
quality DVD rip. There are several factors to consider, and you should
understand these details or else you are likely to end up disappointed
with your results. Below we will investigate some of these issues, and
then have a look at an example. We assume you are using
<code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code> to encode the video,
although the theory applies to other codecs as well.
</p><p>
If this seems to be too much for you, you should probably use one of the
many fine frontends that are listed in the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/projects.html#mencoder_frontends" target="_top">MEncoder section</a>
of our related projects page.
That way, you should be able to achieve high quality rips without too much
thinking, because most of those tools are designed to take clever decisions
for you.

Before you even think about encoding a movie, you need to take
several preliminary steps.
</p><p>
The first and most important step before you encode should be
determining what type of content you are dealing with.
If your source material comes from DVD or broadcast/cable/satellite
TV, it will be stored in one of two formats: NTSC for North
America and Japan, PAL for Europe, etc.
It is important to realize, however, that this is just the formatting for
presentation on a television, and often does
<span class="bold"><strong>not</strong></span> correspond to the
original format of the movie.
Experience shows that NTSC material is a lot more difficult to encode,
because there more elements to identify in the source.
In order to produce a suitable encode, you need to know the original
format.
Failure to take this into account will result in various flaws in your
encode, including ugly combing (interlacing) artifacts and duplicated
or even lost frames.
Besides being ugly, the artifacts also harm coding efficiency:
You will get worse quality per unit bitrate.
</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-preparing-encode-fps"></a>7.1.1.1. Identifying source framerate</h4></div></div></div><p>
Here is a list of common types of source material, where you are
likely to find them, and their properties:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Standard Film</strong></span>: Produced for
  theatrical display at 24fps.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>PAL video</strong></span>: Recorded with a PAL
  video camera at 50 fields per second.
  A field consists of just the odd- or even-numbered lines of a
  frame.
  Television was designed to refresh these in alternation as a
  cheap form of analog compression.
  The human eye supposedly compensates for this, but once you
  understand interlacing you will learn to see it on TV too and
  never enjoy TV again.
  Two fields do <span class="bold"><strong>not</strong></span> make a
  complete frame, because they are captured 1/50 of a second apart
  in time, and thus they do not line up unless there is no motion.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>NTSC Video</strong></span>: Recorded with an
  NTSC video camera at 60000/1001 fields per second, or 60 fields per
  second in the pre-color era.
  Otherwise similar to PAL.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Animation</strong></span>: Usually drawn at
  24fps, but also comes in mixed-framerate varieties.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Computer Graphics (CG)</strong></span>: Can be
  any framerate, but some are more common than others; 24 and
  30 frames per second are typical for NTSC, and 25fps is typical
  for PAL.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Old Film</strong></span>: Various lower
  framerates.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-preparing-encode-material"></a>7.1.1.2. Identifying source material</h4></div></div></div><p>
Movies consisting of frames are referred to as progressive,
while those consisting of independent fields are called
either interlaced or video - though this latter term is
ambiguous.
</p><p>
To further complicate matters, some movies will be a mix of
several of the above.
</p><p>
The most important distinction to make between all of these
formats is that some are frame-based, while others are
field-based.
<span class="bold"><strong>Whenever</strong></span> a movie is prepared
for display on television (including DVD), it is converted to a
field-based format.
The various methods by which this can be done are collectively
referred to as "telecine", of which the infamous NTSC
"3:2 pulldown" is one variety.
Unless the original material was also field-based (and the same
fieldrate), you are getting the movie in a format other than the
original.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>There are several common types of pulldown:</b></p><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>PAL 2:2 pulldown</strong></span>: The nicest of
  them all.
  Each frame is shown for the duration of two fields, by extracting the
  even and odd lines and showing them in alternation.
  If the original material is 24fps, this process speeds up the
  movie by 4%.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>PAL 2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:3 pulldown</strong></span>:
  Every 12th frame is shown for the duration of three fields, instead of
  just two.
  This avoids the 4% speedup issue, but makes the process much
  more difficult to reverse.
  It is usually seen in musical productions where adjusting the
  speed by 4% would seriously damage the musical score.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>NTSC 3:2 telecine</strong></span>: Frames are
  shown alternately for the duration of 3 fields or 2 fields.
  This gives a fieldrate 2.5 times the original framerate.
  The result is also slowed down very slightly from 60 fields per
  second to 60000/1001 fields per second to maintain NTSC fieldrate.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>NTSC 2:2 pulldown</strong></span>: Used for
  showing 30fps material on NTSC.
  Nice, just like 2:2 PAL pulldown.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There are also methods for converting between NTSC and PAL video,
but such topics are beyond the scope of this guide.
If you encounter such a movie and want to encode it, your best
bet is to find a copy in the original format.
Conversion between these two formats is highly destructive and
cannot be reversed cleanly, so your encode will greatly suffer
if it is made from a converted source.
</p><p>
When video is stored on DVD, consecutive pairs of fields are
grouped as a frame, even though they are not intended to be shown
at the same moment in time.
The MPEG-2 standard used on DVD and digital TV provides a
way both to encode the original progressive frames and to store
the number of fields for which a frame should be shown in the
header of that frame.
If this method has been used, the movie will often be described
as "soft-telecined", since the process only directs the
DVD player to apply pulldown to the movie rather than altering
the movie itself.
This case is highly preferable since it can easily be reversed
(actually ignored) by the encoder, and since it preserves maximal
quality.
However, many DVD and broadcast production studios do not use
proper encoding techniques but instead produce movies with
"hard telecine", where fields are actually duplicated in the
encoded MPEG-2.
</p><p>
The procedures for dealing with these cases will be covered
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-telecine.html" title="7.2. How to deal with telecine and interlacing within NTSC DVDs">later in this guide</a>.
For now, we leave you with some guides to identifying which type
of material you are dealing with:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>NTSC regions:</b></p><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
  If <span class="application">MPlayer</span> prints that the framerate
  has changed to 24000/1001 when watching your movie, and never changes
  back, it is almost certainly progressive content that has been
  "soft telecined".
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  If <span class="application">MPlayer</span> shows the framerate
  switching back and forth between 24000/1001 and 30000/1001, and you see
  "combing" at times, then there are several possibilities.
  The 24000/1001 fps segments are almost certainly progressive
  content, "soft telecined", but the 30000/1001 fps parts could be
  either hard-telecined 24000/1001 fps content or 60000/1001 fields per second
  NTSC video.
  Use the same guidelines as the following two cases to determine which.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  If <span class="application">MPlayer</span> never shows the framerate
  changing, and every single frame with motion appears combed, your
  movie is NTSC video at 60000/1001 fields per second.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  If <span class="application">MPlayer</span> never shows the framerate
  changing, and two frames out of every five appear combed, your
  movie is "hard telecined" 24000/1001fps content.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>PAL regions:</b></p><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  If you see combing alternating in and out every half second,
  then your movie is 2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:3 pulldown.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  If you always see combing during motion, then your movie is PAL
  video at 50 fields per second.

</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-2pass"></a>7.1.2. Constant quantizer vs. multipass</h3></div></div></div><p>
It is possible to encode your movie at a wide range of qualities.
With modern video encoders and a bit of pre-codec compression
(downscaling and denoising), it is possible to achieve very good
quality at 700 MB, for a 90-110 minute widescreen movie.
Furthermore, all but the longest movies can be encoded with near-perfect
quality at 1400 MB.
</p><p>
There are three approaches to encoding the video: constant bitrate
(CBR), constant quantizer, and multipass (ABR, or average bitrate).
</p><p>
The complexity of the frames of a movie, and thus the number of bits
required to compress them, can vary greatly from one scene to another.
Modern video encoders can adjust to these needs as they go and vary
the bitrate.
In simple modes such as CBR, however, the encoders do not know the
bitrate needs of future scenes and so cannot exceed the requested
average bitrate for long stretches of time.
More advanced modes, such as multipass encode, can take into account
the statistics from previous passes; this fixes the problem mentioned
above.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note:</h3><p>
Most codecs which support ABR encode only support two pass encode
while some others such as <code class="systemitem">x264</code>,
<code class="systemitem">Xvid</code>
and <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code> support
multipass, which slightly improves quality at each pass,
yet this improvement is no longer measurable nor noticeable after the
4th or so pass.
Therefore, in this section, two pass and multipass will be used
interchangeably.
</p></div><p>
In each of these modes, the video codec (such as
<code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code>)
breaks the video frame into 16x16 pixel macroblocks and then applies a
quantizer to each macroblock. The lower the quantizer, the better the
quality and higher the bitrate.
The method the movie encoder uses to determine
which quantizer to use for a given macroblock varies and is highly
tunable. (This is an extreme over-simplification of the actual
process, but the basic concept is useful to understand.)
</p><p>
When you specify a constant bitrate, the video codec will encode the video,
discarding
detail as much as necessary and as little as possible in order to remain
lower than the given bitrate. If you truly do not care about file size,
you could as well use CBR and specify a bitrate of infinity. (In
practice, this means a value high enough so that it poses no limit, like
10000Kbit.) With no real restriction on bitrate, the result is that
the codec will use the lowest
possible quantizer for each macroblock (as specified by
<tt class="option">vqmin</tt> for
<code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code>, which is 2 by default).
As soon as you specify a
low enough bitrate that the codec
is forced to use a higher quantizer, then you are almost certainly ruining
the quality of your video.
In order to avoid that, you should probably downscale your video, according
to the method described later on in this guide.
In general, you should avoid CBR altogether if you care about quality.
</p><p>
With constant quantizer, the codec uses the same quantizer, as
specified by the <tt class="option">vqscale</tt> option (for
<code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code>), on every macroblock.
If you want the highest quality rip possible, again ignoring bitrate,
you can use <tt class="option">vqscale=2</tt>.
This will yield the same bitrate and PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio)
as CBR with
<tt class="option">vbitrate</tt>=infinity and the default <tt class="option">vqmin</tt>
of 2.
</p><p>
The problem with constant quantizing is that it uses the given quantizer
whether the macroblock needs it or not. That is, it might be possible
to use a higher quantizer on a macroblock without sacrificing visual
quality. Why waste the bits on an unnecessarily low quantizer? Your
CPU has as many cycles as there is time, but there is only so many bits
on your hard disk.
</p><p>
With a two pass encode, the first pass will rip the movie as though it
were CBR, but it will keep a log of properties for each frame. This
data is then used during the second pass in order to make intelligent
decisions about which quantizers to use. During fast action or high
detail scenes, higher quantizers will likely be used, and during
slow moving or low detail scenes, lower quantizers will be used.
Normally, the amount of motion is much more important than the
amount of detail.
</p><p>
If you use <tt class="option">vqscale=2</tt>, then you are wasting bits. If you
use <tt class="option">vqscale=3</tt>, then you are not getting the highest
quality rip. Suppose you rip a DVD at <tt class="option">vqscale=3</tt>, and
the result is 1800Kbit. If you do a two pass encode with
<tt class="option">vbitrate=1800</tt>, the resulting video will have
<span class="bold"><strong>higher quality</strong></span> for the
<span class="bold"><strong>same bitrate</strong></span>.
</p><p>
Since you are now convinced that two pass is the way to go, the real
question now is what bitrate to use? The answer is that there is no
single answer. Ideally you want to choose a bitrate that yields the
best balance between quality and file size. This is going to vary
depending on the source video.
</p><p>
If size does not matter, a good starting point for a very high quality
rip is about 2000Kbit plus or minus 200Kbit.
For fast action or high detail source video, or if you just have a very
critical eye, you might decide on 2400 or 2600.
For some DVDs, you might not notice a difference at 1400Kbit. It is a
good idea to experiment with scenes at different bitrates to get a feel.
</p><p>
If you aim at a certain size, you will have to somehow calculate the bitrate.
But before that, you need to know how much space you should reserve for the
audio track(s), so you should
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4.html#menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-audio" title="7.1.11. Audio">rip those</a> first.
You can compute the bitrate with the following equation:
<code class="systemitem">bitrate = (target_size_in_Mbytes - sound_size_in_Mbytes) *
1024 * 1024 / length_in_secs * 8 / 1000</code>
For instance, to squeeze a two-hour movie onto a 702MB CD, with 60MB
of audio track, the video bitrate will have to be:
<code class="systemitem">(702 - 60) * 1024 * 1024 / (120*60) * 8 / 1000
= 740kbps</code>
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-constraints"></a>7.1.3. Constraints for efficient encoding</h3></div></div></div><p>
Due to the nature of MPEG-type compression, there are various
constraints you should follow for maximal quality.
MPEG splits the video up into 16x16 squares called macroblocks,
each composed of 4 8x8 blocks of luma (intensity) information and two
half-resolution 8x8 chroma (color) blocks (one for red-cyan axis and
the other for the blue-yellow axis).
Even if your movie width and height are not multiples of 16, the
encoder will use enough 16x16 macroblocks to cover the whole picture
area, and the extra space will go to waste.
So in the interests of maximizing quality at a fixed file size, it is
a bad idea to use dimensions that are not multiples of 16.
</p><p>
Most DVDs also have some degree of black borders at the edges. Leaving
these in place will hurt quality <span class="bold"><strong>a lot</strong></span>
in several ways.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
  MPEG-type compression is highly dependent on frequency domain
  transformations, in particular the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT),
  which is similar to the Fourier transform. This sort of encoding is
  efficient for representing patterns and smooth transitions, but it
  has a hard time with sharp edges. In order to encode them it must
  use many more bits, or else an artifact known as ringing will
  appear.
  </p><p>
  The frequency transform (DCT) takes place separately on each
  macroblock (actually each block), so this problem only applies when
  the sharp edge is inside a block. If your black borders begin
  exactly at multiple-of-16 pixel boundaries, this is not a problem.
  However, the black borders on DVDs rarely come nicely aligned, so
  in practice you will always need to crop to avoid this penalty.
  </p></li></ol></div><p>
In addition to frequency domain transforms, MPEG-type compression uses
motion vectors to represent the change from one frame to the next.
Motion vectors naturally work much less efficiently for new content
coming in from the edges of the picture, because it is not present in
the previous frame. As long as the picture extends all the way to the
edge of the encoded region, motion vectors have no problem with
content moving out the edges of the picture. However, in the presence
of black borders, there can be trouble:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" start="2" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
  For each macroblock, MPEG-type compression stores a vector
  identifying which part of the previous frame should be copied into
  this macroblock as a base for predicting the next frame. Only the
  remaining differences need to be encoded. If a macroblock spans the
  edge of the picture and contains part of the black border, then
  motion vectors from other parts of the picture will overwrite the
  black border. This means that lots of bits must be spent either
  re-blackening the border that was overwritten, or (more likely) a
  motion vector will not be used at all and all the changes in this
  macroblock will have to be coded explicitly. Either way, encoding
  efficiency is greatly reduced.
  </p><p>
  Again, this problem only applies if black borders do not line up on
  multiple-of-16 boundaries.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Finally, suppose we have a macroblock in the interior of the
  picture, and an object is moving into this block from near the edge
  of the image. MPEG-type coding cannot say "copy the part that is
  inside the picture but not the black border." So the black border
  will get copied inside too, and lots of bits will have to be spent
  encoding the part of the picture that is supposed to be there.
  </p><p>
  If the picture runs all the way to the edge of the encoded area,
  MPEG has special optimizations to repeatedly copy the pixels at the
  edge of the picture when a motion vector comes from outside the
  encoded area. This feature becomes useless when the movie has black
  borders. Unlike problems 1 and 2, aligning the borders at multiples
  of 16 does not help here.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Despite the borders being entirely black and never changing, there
  is at least a minimal amount of overhead involved in having more
  macroblocks.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
For all of these reasons, it is recommended to fully crop black
borders. Further, if there is an area of noise/distortion at the edge
of the picture, cropping this will improve encoding efficiency as
well. Videophile purists who want to preserve the original as close as
possible may object to this cropping, but unless you plan to encode at
constant quantizer, the quality you gain from cropping will
considerably exceed the amount of information lost at the edges.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-crop"></a>7.1.4. Cropping and Scaling</h3></div></div></div><p>
Recall from the previous section that the final picture size you
encode should be a multiple of 16 (in both width and height).
This can be achieved by cropping, scaling, or a combination of both.
</p><p>
When cropping, there are a few guidelines that must be followed to
avoid damaging your movie.
The normal YUV format, 4:2:0, stores chroma (color) information
subsampled, i.e. chroma is only sampled half as often in each
direction as luma (intensity) information.

As you can see, rows and columns of the image naturally come in pairs.
Thus your crop offsets and dimensions <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be
even numbers.
If they are not, the chroma will no longer line up correctly with the
luma.
In theory, it is possible to crop with odd offsets, but it requires
resampling the chroma which is potentially a lossy operation and not
supported by the crop filter.

As you can see, the pattern does not repeat until after 4 lines.
So for interlaced video, your y-offset and height for cropping must
be multiples of 4.
</p><p>
Native DVD resolution is 720x480 for NTSC, and 720x576 for PAL, but
there is an aspect flag that specifies whether it is full-screen (4:3) or
wide-screen (16:9). Many (if not most) widescreen DVDs are not strictly
16:9, and will be either 1.85:1 or 2.35:1 (cinescope). This means that
there will be black bands in the video that will need to be cropped out.
</p><p>
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> provides a crop detection filter that
will determine the crop rectangle (<tt class="option">-vf cropdetect</tt>).
Run <span class="application">MPlayer</span> with
<tt class="option">-vf cropdetect</tt> and it will print out the crop
settings to remove the borders.
You should let the movie run long enough that the whole picture
area is used, in order to get accurate crop values.
</p><p>
Then, test the values you get with <span class="application">MPlayer</span>,
using the command line which was printed by
<tt class="option">cropdetect</tt>, and adjust the rectangle as needed.
The <tt class="option">rectangle</tt> filter can help by allowing you to
interactively position the crop rectangle over your movie.
Remember to follow the above divisibility guidelines so that you
do not misalign the chroma planes.
</p><p>
In certain cases, scaling may be undesirable.
Scaling in the vertical direction is difficult with interlaced
video, and if you wish to preserve the interlacing, you should
usually refrain from scaling.
If you will not be scaling but you still want to use multiple-of-16
dimensions, you will have to overcrop.
Do not undercrop, since black borders are very bad for encoding!
</p><p>
Because MPEG-4 uses 16x16 macroblocks, you will want to make sure that each
dimension of the video you are encoding is a multiple of 16 or else you
will be degrading quality, especially at lower bitrates. You can do this
by rounding the width and height of the crop rectangle down to the nearest
multiple of 16.
As stated earlier, when cropping, you will want to increase the Y offset by
half the difference of the old and the new height so that the resulting
video is taken from the center of the frame. And because of the way DVD
video is sampled, make sure the offset is an even number. (In fact, as a
rule, never use odd values for any parameter when you are cropping and
scaling video.) If you are not comfortable throwing a few extra pixels
away, you might prefer to scale the video instead. We will look
at this in our example below.
You can actually let the <tt class="option">cropdetect</tt> filter do all of the
above for you, as it has an optional <tt class="option">round</tt> parameter that
is equal to 16 by default.
</p><p>
Also, be careful about "half black" pixels at the edges. Make sure you
crop these out too, or else you will be wasting bits there that
are better spent elsewhere.
</p><p>
After all is said and done, you will probably end up with video whose pixels
are not quite 1.85:1 or 2.35:1, but rather something close to that. You
could calculate the new aspect ratio manually, but
<span class="application">MEncoder</span> offers an option for <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code> called <tt class="option">autoaspect</tt>
that will do this for you. Absolutely do not scale this video up in order to
square the pixels unless you like to waste your hard disk space. Scaling
should be done on playback, and the player will use the aspect stored in
the AVI to determine the correct resolution.
Unfortunately, not all players enforce this auto-scaling information,
therefore you may still want to rescale.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-resolution-bitrate"></a>7.1.5. Choosing resolution and bitrate</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you will not be encoding in constant quantizer mode, you need to
select a bitrate.
The concept of bitrate is quite simple.
It is the (average) number of bits that will be consumed to store your
movie, per second.
Normally bitrate is measured in kilobits (1000 bits) per second.
The size of your movie on disk is the bitrate times the length of the
movie in time, plus a small amount of "overhead" (see the section on
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4.html#menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-muxing-avi-limitations" title="7.1.12.2. Limitations of the AVI container">the AVI container</a>
for instance).
Other parameters such as scaling, cropping, etc. will
<span class="bold"><strong>not</strong></span> alter the file size unless you
change the bitrate as well!
</p><p>
Bitrate does <span class="bold"><strong>not</strong></span> scale proportionally
to resolution.
That is to say, a 320x240 file at 200 kbit/sec will not be the same
quality as the same movie at 640x480 and 800 kbit/sec!
There are two reasons for this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Perceptual</strong></span>: You notice MPEG
  artifacts more if they are scaled up bigger!
  Artifacts appear on the scale of blocks (8x8).
  Your eye will not see errors in 4800 small blocks as easily as it
  sees errors in 1200 large blocks (assuming you will be scaling both
  to fullscreen).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Theoretical</strong></span>: When you scale down
  an image but still use the same size (8x8) blocks for the frequency
  space transform, you move more data to the high frequency bands.
  Roughly speaking, each pixel contains more of the detail than it
  did before.
  So even though your scaled-down picture contains 1/4 the information
  in the spacial directions, it could still contain a large portion
  of the information in the frequency domain (assuming that the high
  frequencies were underutilized in the original 640x480 image).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p><p>
Past guides have recommended choosing a bitrate and resolution based
on a "bits per pixel" approach, but this is usually not valid due to
the above reasons.
A better estimate seems to be that bitrates scale proportional to the
square root of resolution, so that 320x240 and 400 kbit/sec would be
comparable to 640x480 at 800 kbit/sec.
However this has not been verified with theoretical or empirical
rigor.
Further, given that movies vary greatly with regard to noise, detail,
degree of motion, etc., it is futile to make general recommendations
for bits per length-of-diagonal (the analog of bits per pixel,
using the square root).
</p><p>
So far we have discussed the difficulty of choosing a bitrate and
resolution.
</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-resolution-bitrate-compute"></a>7.1.5.1. Computing the resolution</h4></div></div></div><p>
The following steps will guide you in computing the resolution of your
encode without distorting the video too much, by taking into account several
types of information about the source video.
First, you should compute the encoded aspect ratio:
<code class="systemitem">ARc = (Wc x (ARa / PRdvd )) / Hc</code>

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>where:</b></p><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
  Wc and Hc are the width and height of the cropped video,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  ARa is the displayed aspect ratio, which usually is 4/3 or 16/9,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  PRdvd is the pixel ratio of the DVD which is equal to 1.25=(720/576) for PAL
  DVDs and 1.5=(720/480) for NTSC DVDs.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
Then, you can compute the X and Y resolution, according to a certain
Compression Quality (CQ) factor:
<code class="systemitem">ResY = INT(SQRT( 1000*Bitrate/25/ARc/CQ )/16) * 16</code>
and
<code class="systemitem">ResX = INT( ResY * ARc / 16) * 16</code>
</p><p>
Okay, but what is the CQ?
The CQ represents the number of bits per pixel and per frame of the encode.
Roughly speaking, the greater the CQ, the less the likelihood to see
encoding artifacts.
However, if you have a target size for your movie (1 or 2 CDs for instance),
there is a limited total number of bits that you can spend; therefore it is
necessary to find a good tradeoff between compressibility and quality.
</p><p>
The CQ depends on the bitrate, the video codec efficiency and the
movie resolution.
In order to raise the CQ, typically you would downscale the movie given that the
bitrate is computed in function of the target size and the length of the
movie, which are constant.
With MPEG-4 ASP codecs such as <code class="systemitem">Xvid</code>
and <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code>, a CQ below 0.18
usually results in a pretty blocky picture, because there
are not enough bits to code the information of each macroblock. (MPEG4, like
many other codecs, groups pixels by blocks of several pixels to compress the
image; if there are not enough bits, the edges of those blocks are
visible.)
It is therefore wise to take a CQ ranging from 0.20 to 0.22 for a 1 CD rip,
and 0.26-0.28 for 2 CDs rip with standard encoding options.
More advanced encoding options such as those listed here for
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-enc-libavcodec.html#menc-feat-mpeg4-lavc-example-settings" title="7.3.4. Encoding setting examples"><code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code></a>
and
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-xvid.html#menc-feat-xvid-example-settings" title="7.4.4. Encoding setting examples"><code class="systemitem">Xvid</code></a>
should make it possible to get the same quality with CQ ranging from
0.18 to 0.20 for a 1 CD rip, and 0.24 to 0.26 for a 2 CD rip.
With MPEG-4 AVC codecs such as <code class="systemitem">x264</code>,
you can use a CQ ranging from 0.14 to 0.16 with standard encoding options,
and should be able to go as low as 0.10 to 0.12 with
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-x264.html#menc-feat-x264-example-settings" title="7.5.2. Encoding setting examples"><code class="systemitem">x264</code>'s advanced encoding settings</a>.
</p><p>
Please take note that the CQ is just an indicative figure, as depending on
the encoded content, a CQ of 0.18 may look just fine for a Bergman, contrary
to a movie such as The Matrix, which contains many high-motion scenes.
On the other hand, it is worthless to raise CQ higher than 0.30 as you would
be wasting bits without any noticeable quality gain.
Also note that as mentioned earlier in this guide, low resolution videos
need a bigger CQ (compared to, for instance, DVD resolution) to look good.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-filtering"></a>7.1.6. Filtering</h3></div></div></div><p>
Learning how to use <span class="application">MEncoder</span>'s video filters
is essential to producing good encodes.
All video processing is performed through the filters -- cropping,
scaling, color adjustment, noise removal, sharpening, deinterlacing,
telecine, inverse telecine, and deblocking, just to name a few.
Along with the vast number of supported input formats, the variety of
filters available in <span class="application">MEncoder</span> is one of its
main advantages over other similar programs.
</p><p>
Filters are loaded in a chain using the -vf option:

</p><pre class="screen">-vf filter1=options,filter2=options,...</pre><p>

Most filters take several numeric options separated by colons, but
the syntax for options varies from filter to filter, so read the man
page for details on the filters you wish to use.
</p><p>
Filters operate on the video in the order they are loaded.
For example, the following chain:

</p><pre class="screen">-vf crop=688:464:12:4,scale=640:464</pre><p>

will first crop the 688x464 region of the picture with upper-left
corner at (12,4), and then scale the result down to 640x464.
</p><p>
Certain filters need to be loaded at or near the beginning of the
filter chain, in order to take advantage of information from the
video decoder that will be lost or invalidated by other filters.
The principal examples are <tt class="option">pp</tt> (postprocessing, only
when it is performing deblock or dering operations),
<tt class="option">spp</tt> (another postprocessor to remove MPEG artifacts),
<tt class="option">pullup</tt> (inverse telecine), and
<tt class="option">softpulldown</tt> (for converting soft telecine to hard telecine).
</p><p>
In general, you want to do as little filtering as possible to the movie
in order to remain close to the original DVD source. Cropping is often
necessary (as described above), but avoid to scale the video. Although
scaling down is sometimes preferred to using higher quantizers, we want
to avoid both these things: remember that we decided from the start to
trade bits for quality.
</p><p>
Also, do not adjust gamma, contrast, brightness, etc. What looks good
on your display may not look good on others. These adjustments should
be done on playback only.
</p><p>
One thing you might want to do, however, is pass the video through a
very light denoise filter, such as <tt class="option">-vf hqdn3d=2:1:2</tt>.
Again, it is a matter of putting those bits to better use: why waste them
encoding noise when you can just add that noise back in during playback?
Increasing the parameters for <tt class="option">hqdn3d</tt> will further
improve compressibility, but if you increase the values too much, you
risk degrading the image visibly. The suggested values above
(<tt class="option">2:1:2</tt>) are quite conservative; you should feel free to
experiment with higher values and observe the results for yourself.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-interlacing"></a>7.1.7. Interlacing and Telecine</h3></div></div></div><p>
Almost all movies are shot at 24 fps. Because NTSC is 30000/1001 fps, some
processing must be done to this 24 fps video to make it run at the correct
NTSC framerate. The process is called 3:2 pulldown, commonly referred to
as telecine (because pulldown is often applied during the telecine
process), and, naively described, it works by slowing the film down to
24000/1001 fps, and repeating every fourth frame.
</p><p>
No special processing, however, is done to the video for PAL DVDs, which
run at 25 fps. (Technically, PAL can be telecined, called 2:2 pulldown,
but this does not become an issue in practice.) The 24 fps film is simply
played back at 25 fps. The result is that the movie runs slightly faster,
but unless you are an alien, you probably will not notice the difference.
Most PAL DVDs have pitch-corrected audio, so when they are played back at
25 fps things will sound right, even though the audio track (and hence the
whole movie) has a running time that is 4% less than NTSC DVDs.
</p><p>
Because the video in a PAL DVD has not been altered, you need not worry
much about framerate. The source is 25 fps, and your rip will be 25
fps. However, if you are ripping an NTSC DVD movie, you may need to
apply inverse telecine.
</p><p>
For movies shot at 24 fps, the video on the NTSC DVD is either telecined
30000/1001, or else it is progressive 24000/1001 fps and intended to be
telecined on-the-fly by a DVD player. On the other hand, TV series are usually
only interlaced, not telecined. This is not a hard rule: some TV series
are interlaced (such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer) whereas some are a
mixture of progressive and interlaced (such as Angel, or 24).
</p><p>
It is highly recommended that you read the section on
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-telecine.html" title="7.2. How to deal with telecine and interlacing within NTSC DVDs">How to deal with telecine and interlacing in NTSC DVDs</a>
to learn how to handle the different possibilities.
</p><p>
However, if you are mostly just ripping movies, likely you are either
dealing with 24 fps progressive or telecined video, in which case you can
use the <tt class="option">pullup</tt> filter <tt class="option">-vf
pullup,softskip</tt>.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-encoding-interlaced"></a>7.1.8. Encoding interlaced video</h3></div></div></div><p>
If the movie you want to encode is interlaced (NTSC video or
PAL video), you will need to choose whether you want to
deinterlace or not.
While deinterlacing will make your movie usable on progressive
scan displays such a computer monitors and projectors, it comes
at a cost: The fieldrate of 50 or 60000/1001 fields per second
is halved to 25 or 30000/1001 frames per second, and roughly half of
the information in your movie will be lost during scenes with
significant motion.
</p><p>
Therefore, if you are encoding for high quality archival purposes,
it is recommended not to deinterlace.
You can always deinterlace the movie at playback time when
displaying it on progressive scan devices.
The power of currently available computers forces players to use a
deinterlacing filter, which results in a slight degradation in
image quality.
But future players will be able to mimic the interlaced display of
a TV, deinterlacing to full fieldrate and interpolating 50 or
60000/1001 entire frames per second from the interlaced video.
</p><p>
Special care must be taken when working with interlaced video:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
  Crop height and y-offset must be multiples of 4.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Any vertical scaling must be performed in interlaced mode.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Postprocessing and denoising filters may not work as expected
  unless you take special care to operate them a field at a time,
  and they may damage the video if used incorrectly.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
With these things in mind, here is our first example:
</p><pre class="screen">
mencoder <em class="replaceable"><code>capture.avi</code></em> -mc 0 -oac lavc -ovc lavc -lavcopts \
    vcodec=mpeg2video:vbitrate=6000:ilme:ildct:acodec=mp2:abitrate=224
</pre><p>
Note the <tt class="option">ilme</tt> and <tt class="option">ildct</tt> options.

<span class="application">MEncoder</span>'s audio/video synchronization
algorithms were designed with the intention of recovering files with
broken sync.
However, in some cases they can cause unnecessary skipping and duplication of
frames, and possibly slight A/V desync, when used with proper input
(of course, A/V sync issues apply only if you process or copy the
audio track while transcoding the video, which is strongly encouraged).
Therefore, you may have to switch to basic A/V sync with
the <tt class="option">-mc 0</tt> option, or put this in your
<code class="systemitem">~/.mplayer/mencoder</code> config file, as long as
you are only working with good sources (DVD, TV capture, high quality
MPEG-4 rips, etc) and not broken ASF/RM/MOV files.
</p><p>
If you want to further guard against strange frame skips and
duplication, you can use both <tt class="option">-mc 0</tt> and
<tt class="option">-noskip</tt>.
This will prevent <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> A/V sync, and copy frames
one-to-one, so you cannot use it if you will be using any filters that
unpredictably add or drop frames, or if your input file has variable
framerate!
Therefore, using <tt class="option">-noskip</tt> is not in general recommended.
</p><p>
The so-called "three-pass" audio encoding which
<span class="application">MEncoder</span> supports has been reported to cause A/V
desync.
This will definitely happen if it is used in conjunction with certain
filters, therefore, it is now recommended <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to
use three-pass audio mode.
This feature is only left for compatibility purposes and for expert
users who understand when it is safe to use and when it is not.
If you have never heard of three-pass mode before, forget that we
even mentioned it!
</p><p>
There have also been reports of A/V desync when encoding from stdin
with <span class="application">MEncoder</span>.
Do not do this! Always use a file or CD/DVD/etc device as input.

Which video codec is best to choose depends on several factors,
like size, quality, streamability, usability and popularity, some of
which widely depend on personal taste and technical constraints.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Compression efficiency</strong></span>:
  It is quite easy to understand that most newer-generation codecs are
  made to increase quality and compression.
  Therefore, the authors of this guide and many other people suggest that
  you cannot go wrong
  <a href="#ftn.fn-menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-codec-cpu" class="footnote" name="fn-menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-codec-cpu"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>
  when choosing MPEG-4 AVC codecs like
  <code class="systemitem">x264</code> instead of MPEG-4 ASP codecs
  such as <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code> MPEG-4 or
  <code class="systemitem">Xvid</code>.
  (Advanced codec developers may be interested in reading Michael
  Niedermayer's opinion on
  "<a class="ulink" href="http://guru.multimedia.cx/?p=10" target="_top">why MPEG4-ASP sucks</a>".)
  Likewise, you should get better quality using MPEG-4 ASP than you
  would with MPEG-2 codecs.
  </p><p>
  However, newer codecs which are in heavy development can suffer from
  bugs which have not yet been noticed and which can ruin an encode.
  This is simply the tradeoff for using bleeding-edge technology.
  </p><p>
  What is more, beginning to use a new codec requires that you spend some
  time becoming familiar with its options, so that you know what
  to adjust to achieve a desired picture quality.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Hardware compatibility</strong></span>:
  It usually takes a long time for standalone video players to begin to
  include support for the latest video codecs.
  As a result, most only support MPEG-1 (like VCD, XVCD and KVCD), MPEG-2
  (like DVD, SVCD and KVCD) and MPEG-4 ASP (like DivX,
  <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code>'s LMP4 and
  <code class="systemitem">Xvid</code>)
  (Beware: Usually, not all MPEG-4 ASP features are supported).
  Please refer to the technical specs of your player (if they are available),
  or google around for more information.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Best quality per encoding time</strong></span>:
  Codecs that have been around for some time (such as
  <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code> MPEG-4 and
  <code class="systemitem">Xvid</code>) are usually heavily
  optimized with all kinds of smart algorithms and SIMD assembly code.
  That is why they tend to yield the best quality per encoding time ratio.
  However, they may have some very advanced options that, if enabled,
  will make the encode really slow for marginal gains.
  </p><p>
  If you are after blazing speed you should stick around the default
  settings of the video codec (although you should still try the other
  options which are mentioned in other sections of this guide).
  </p><p>
  You may also consider choosing a codec which can do multi-threaded
  processing, though this is only useful for users of machines with
  several CPUs.
  <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code> MPEG-4 does
  allow that, but speed gains are limited, and there is a slight
  negative effect on picture quality.
  <code class="systemitem">Xvid</code>'s multi-threaded encoding,
  activated by the <tt class="option">threads</tt> option, can be used to
  boost encoding speed — by about 40-60% in typical cases —
  with little if any picture degradation.
  <code class="systemitem">x264</code> also allows multi-threaded
  encoding, which currently speeds up encoding by 94% per CPU core while
  lowering PSNR between 0.005dB and 0.01dB on a typical setup.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Personal taste</strong></span>:
  This is where it gets almost irrational: For the same reason that some
  hung on to DivX 3 for years when newer codecs were already doing wonders,
  some folks will prefer <code class="systemitem">Xvid</code>
  or <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code> MPEG-4 over
  <code class="systemitem">x264</code>.
  </p><p>
  You should make your own judgement; do not take advice from people who
  swear by one codec.
  Take a few sample clips from raw sources and compare different
  encoding options and codecs to find one that suits you best.
  The best codec is the one you master, and the one that looks
  best to your eyes on your display
  <a href="#ftn.fn-menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-codec-playback" class="footnote" name="fn-menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-codec-playback"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a>!
  </p></li></ul></div><p>
Please refer to the section
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-selecting-codec.html" title="6.1. 选择编解码器及容器格式">selecting codecs and container formats</a>
to get a list of supported codecs.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-audio"></a>7.1.11. Audio</h3></div></div></div><p>
Audio is a much simpler problem to solve: if you care about quality, just
leave it as is.
Even AC-3 5.1 streams are at most 448Kbit/s, and they are worth every bit.
You might be tempted to transcode the audio to high quality Vorbis, but
just because you do not have an A/V receiver for AC-3 pass-through today
does not mean you will not have one tomorrow. Future-proof your DVD rips by
preserving the AC-3 stream.
You can keep the AC-3 stream either by copying it directly into the video
stream <a class="link" href="menc-feat-mpeg4.html" title='6.3. 编码为双通道MPEG-4 ("DivX")'>during the encoding</a>.
You can also extract the AC-3 stream in order to mux it into containers such
as NUT or Matroska.
</p><pre class="screen">
mplayer <em class="replaceable"><code>source_file.vob</code></em> -aid 129 -dumpaudio -dumpfile <em class="replaceable"><code>sound.ac3</code></em>
</pre><p>
will dump into the file <em class="replaceable"><code>sound.ac3</code></em> the
audio track number 129 from the file
<em class="replaceable"><code>source_file.vob</code></em> (NB: DVD VOB files
usually use a different audio numbering,
which means that the VOB audio track 129 is the 2nd audio track of the file).
</p><p>
But sometimes you truly have no choice but to further compress the
sound so that more bits can be spent on the video.
Most people choose to compress audio with either MP3 or Vorbis audio codecs.
While the latter is a very space-efficient codec, MP3 is better supported
by hardware players, although this trend is changing.
</p><p>
Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> use <tt class="option">-nosound</tt> when encoding
a file with audio, even if you will be encoding and muxing audio
separately later.
Though it may work in ideal cases, using <tt class="option">-nosound</tt> is
likely to hide some problems in your encoding command line setting.
In other words, having a soundtrack during your encode assures you that,
provided you do not see messages such as
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Too many audio packets in the buffer</span>”</span>, you will be able
to get proper sync.
</p><p>
You need to have <span class="application">MEncoder</span> process the sound.
You can for example copy the original soundtrack during the encode with
<tt class="option">-oac copy</tt> or convert it to a "light" 4 kHz mono WAV
PCM with <tt class="option">-oac pcm -channels 1 -srate 4000</tt>.
Otherwise, in some cases, it will generate a video file that will not sync
with the audio.
Such cases are when the number of video frames in the source file does
not match up to the total length of audio frames or whenever there
are discontinuities/splices where there are missing or extra audio frames.
The correct way to handle this kind of problem is to insert silence or
cut audio at these points.
However <span class="application">MPlayer</span> cannot do that, so if you
demux the AC-3 audio and encode it with a separate app (or dump it to PCM with
<span class="application">MPlayer</span>), the splices will be left incorrect
and the only way to correct them is to drop/duplicate video frames at the
splice.
As long as <span class="application">MEncoder</span> sees the audio when it is
encoding the video, it can do this dropping/duping (which is usually OK
since it takes place at full black/scene change), but if
<span class="application">MEncoder</span> cannot see the audio, it will just
process all frames as-is and they will not fit the final audio stream when
you for example merge your audio and video track into a Matroska file.
</p><p>
First of all, you will have to convert the DVD sound into a WAV file that the
audio codec can use as input.
For example:
</p><pre class="screen">
mplayer <em class="replaceable"><code>source_file.vob</code></em> -ao pcm:file=<em class="replaceable"><code>destination_sound.wav</code></em> \
    -vc dummy -aid 1 -vo null
</pre><p>
will dump the second audio track from the file
<em class="replaceable"><code>source_file.vob</code></em> into the file
<em class="replaceable"><code>destination_sound.wav</code></em>.
You may want to normalize the sound before encoding, as DVD audio tracks
are commonly recorded at low volumes.
You can use the tool <span class="application">normalize</span> for instance,
which is available in most distributions.
If you are using Windows, a tool such as <span class="application">BeSweet</span>
can do the same job.
You will compress in either Vorbis or MP3.
For example:
</p><pre class="screen">oggenc -q1 <em class="replaceable"><code>destination_sound.wav</code></em></pre><p>
will encode <em class="replaceable"><code>destination_sound.wav</code></em> with
the encoding quality 1, which is roughly equivalent to 80Kb/s, and
is the minimum quality at which you should encode if you care about
quality.
Please note that <span class="application">MEncoder</span> currently cannot
mux Vorbis audio tracks
into the output file because it only supports AVI and MPEG
containers as an output, each of which may lead to audio/video
playback synchronization problems with some players when the AVI file
contain VBR audio streams such as Vorbis.
Do not worry, this document will show you how you can do that with third
party programs.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-muxing"></a>7.1.12. Muxing</h3></div></div></div><p>
Now that you have encoded your video, you will most likely want
to mux it with one or more audio tracks into a movie container, such
as AVI, MPEG, Matroska or NUT.
<span class="application">MEncoder</span> is currently only able to natively output
audio and video into MPEG and AVI container formats.
for example:
</p><pre class="screen">
mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy  -o <em class="replaceable"><code>output_movie.avi</code></em> \
    -audiofile <em class="replaceable"><code>input_audio.mp2</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>input_video.avi</code></em>
</pre><p>
This would merge the video file <em class="replaceable"><code>input_video.avi</code></em>
and the audio file <em class="replaceable"><code>input_audio.mp2</code></em>
into the AVI file <em class="replaceable"><code>output_movie.avi</code></em>.
This command works with MPEG-1 layer I, II and III (more commonly known
as MP3) audio, WAV and a few other audio formats too.
</p><p>
<span class="application">MEncoder</span> features experimental support for
<code class="systemitem">libavformat</code>, which is a
library from the FFmpeg project that supports muxing and demuxing
a variety of containers.
For example:
</p><pre class="screen">
mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -o <em class="replaceable"><code>output_movie.asf</code></em> -audiofile <em class="replaceable"><code>input_audio.mp2</code></em> \
    <em class="replaceable"><code>input_video.avi</code></em> -of lavf -lavfopts format=asf
</pre><p>
This will do the same thing as the previous example, except that
the output container will be ASF.
Please note that this support is highly experimental (but getting
better every day), and will only work if you compiled
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> with the support for
<code class="systemitem">libavformat</code> enabled (which
means that a pre-packaged binary version will not work in most cases).
</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-muxing-filter-issues"></a>7.1.12.1. Improving muxing and A/V sync reliability</h4></div></div></div><p>
You may experience some serious A/V sync problems while trying to mux
your video and some audio tracks, where no matter how you adjust the
audio delay, you will never get proper sync.
That may happen when you use some video filters that will drop or
duplicate some frames, like the inverse telecine filters.
It is strongly encouraged to append the <tt class="option">harddup</tt> video
filter at the end of the filter chain to avoid this kind of problem.
</p><p>
Without <tt class="option">harddup</tt>, if <span class="application">MEncoder</span>
wants to duplicate a frame, it relies on the muxer to put a mark on the
container so that the last frame will be displayed again to maintain
sync while writing no actual frame.
With <tt class="option">harddup</tt>, <span class="application">MEncoder</span>
will instead just push the last frame displayed again into the filter
chain.
This means that the encoder receives the <span class="emphasis"><em>exact</em></span>
same frame twice, and compresses it.
This will result in a slightly bigger file, but will not cause problems
when demuxing or remuxing into other container formats.
</p><p>
You may also have no choice but to use <tt class="option">harddup</tt> with
container formats that are not too tightly linked with
<span class="application">MEncoder</span> such as the ones supported through
<code class="systemitem">libavformat</code>, which may not
support frame duplication at the container level.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-muxing-avi-limitations"></a>7.1.12.2. Limitations of the AVI container</h4></div></div></div><p>
Although it is the most widely-supported container format after MPEG-1,
AVI also has some major drawbacks.
Perhaps the most obvious is the overhead.
For each chunk of the AVI file, 24 bytes are wasted on headers and index.
This translates into a little over 5 MB per hour, or 1-2.5%
overhead for a 700 MB movie. This may not seem like much, but it could
mean the difference between being able to use 700 kbit/sec video or
714 kbit/sec, and every bit of quality counts.
</p><p>
In addition this gross inefficiency, AVI also has the following major
limitations:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
  Only fixed-fps content can be stored. This is particularly limiting
  if the original material you want to encode is mixed content, for
  example a mix of NTSC video and film material.
  Actually there are hacks that can be used to store mixed-framerate
  content in AVI, but they increase the (already huge) overhead
  fivefold or more and so are not practical.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Audio in AVI files must be either constant-bitrate (CBR) or
  constant-framesize (i.e. all frames decode to the same number of
  samples).
  Unfortunately, the most efficient codec, Vorbis, does not meet
  either of these requirements.
  Therefore, if you plan to store your movie in AVI, you will have to
  use a less efficient codec such as MP3 or AC-3.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Having said all that, <span class="application">MEncoder</span> does not
currently support variable-fps output or Vorbis encoding.
Therefore, you may not see these as limitations if
<span class="application">MEncoder</span> is the
only tool you will be using to produce your encodes.
However, it is possible to use <span class="application">MEncoder</span>
only for video encoding, and then use external tools to encode
audio and mux it into another container format.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-muxing-matroska"></a>7.1.12.3. Muxing into the Matroska container</h4></div></div></div><p>
Matroska is a free, open standard container format, aiming
to offer a lot of advanced features, which older containers
like AVI cannot handle.
For example, Matroska supports variable bitrate audio content
(VBR), variable framerates (VFR), chapters, file attachments,
error detection code (EDC) and modern A/V Codecs like "Advanced Audio
Coding" (AAC), "Vorbis" or "MPEG-4 AVC" (H.264), next to nothing
handled by AVI.
</p><p>
The tools required to create Matroska files are collectively called
<span class="application">mkvtoolnix</span>, and are available for most
Unix platforms as well as <span class="application">Windows</span>.
Because Matroska is an open standard you may find other
tools that suit you better, but since mkvtoolnix is the most
common, and is supported by the Matroska team itself, we will
only cover its usage.
</p><p>
Probably the easiest way to get started with Matroska is to use
<span class="application">MMG</span>, the graphical frontend shipped with
<span class="application">mkvtoolnix</span>, and follow the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/doc/mkvmerge-gui.html" target="_top">guide to mkvmerge GUI (mmg)</a>
</p><p>
You may also mux audio and video files using the command line:
</p><pre class="screen">
mkvmerge -o <em class="replaceable"><code>output.mkv</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>input_video.avi</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>input_audio1.mp3</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>input_audio2.ac3</code></em>
</pre><p>
This would merge the video file <em class="replaceable"><code>input_video.avi</code></em>
and the two audio files <em class="replaceable"><code>input_audio1.mp3</code></em>
and <em class="replaceable"><code>input_audio2.ac3</code></em> into the Matroska
file <em class="replaceable"><code>output.mkv</code></em>.
Matroska, as mentioned earlier, is able to do much more than that, like
multiple audio tracks (including fine-tuning of audio/video
synchronization), chapters, subtitles, splitting, etc...
Please refer to the documentation of those applications for
more details.
