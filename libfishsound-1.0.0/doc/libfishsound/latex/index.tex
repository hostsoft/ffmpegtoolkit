\section{Fish\-Sound, the sound of fish!}\label{index_intro}
This is the documentation for the Fish\-Sound C A\-P\-I. Fish\-Sound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and encoding audio data using Xiph.\-Org codecs (F\-L\-A\-C, Speex and Vorbis).

libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a lower level layer such as U\-D\-P datagrams. When these codecs are used in files, they are commonly encapsulated in {\tt Ogg} to produce {\itshape Ogg F\-L\-A\-C}, {\itshape Speex} and {\itshape Ogg Vorbis} files. Example C programs using {\tt liboggz} to read and write these files are provided in the libfishsound sources.

For more information on the design and history of libfishsound, see the \doxyref{About }{p.}{group__about} section of this documentation, and the {\tt libfishsound} homepage.\subsection{Contents}\label{index_contents}
